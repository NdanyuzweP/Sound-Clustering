# Sound Dataset Clustering  

## Overview  
This project applies **clustering techniques** to an **unlabeled sound dataset** to analyze patterns, optimize clustering parameters, and evaluate different algorithms. The assignment involves:  
- Feature extraction using **Mel Spectrogram**.  
- **Dimensionality reduction** with PCA and t-SNE.  
- **Clustering with K-Means and DBSCAN**.  
- **Performance evaluation** using metrics like Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index.

## Key Findings & Real-World Application
K-Means is best for structured data like market segmentation or speech recognition.
DBSCAN is useful for noise handling, like anomaly detection in cybersecurity.
Dimensionality reduction is essential in high-dimensional datasets to enhance clustering quality.
